    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
      As an aspiring frontend developer, I am passionate about creating
      user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. My journey in web
      development began during my studies in Computer Science, and I have been
      continuously expanding my knowledge and skills in modern frontend
      technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently working as a Trainee Frontend Angular Developer at Technofex,
      I've been gaining valuable hands-on experience in Angular development,
      state management with NgRx, and implementing UI components using Angular
      Material. I'm particularly interested in responsive design and creating
      accessible user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest
      technologies in the frontend ecosystem. My goal is to grow as a developer
      and contribute to projects that make a positive impact through technology.
